 well I would imagine the most pertinent stuff besides security would be billing
 however I wouldn't have access to that for testing.
 however i'd still like to play with it.
 
 client = boto3.client('budgets')
 response = client.describe_budget(
    AccountId='string',
    BudgetName='string'
)
response :: {
    'Budget': {
        'BudgetName': 'string',
        'BudgetLimit': {
            'Amount': 'string', right here would be nice, through a few loops and set a varible so it can be compared to 'ForecastedSpend'
            'Unit': 'string'
there is also "HistoricalOptions" that could be useful in another function

client = boto3.client('ec2')
response = client.describe_vpn_connections()
'CustomerGatewayId' 'State' 'Options : OutsideIpAddressType'
for who is outside connected using a VPN.

client = boto3.client('ec2') AFTER RUNNING SOMETHING THAT LOOKS FOR STOPPED OR TERMED INSTANCES
response = client.get_console_output(InstanceId='string')
{
    'InstanceId': 'string',
    'Output': 'string',
    'Timestamp': datetime(2015, 1, 1)
}
you could use it to check a sys log to see why it shut unexpectedly
